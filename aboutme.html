        <p id="atxt">
            I am Vidhu Mon TV, a passionate artist and illustrator dedicated to crafting visual narratives that
            captivate the imagination. My artistic journey began at the prestigious Raja Ravivarma College of Pine Arts,
            Mavelikkara, where I graduated in 2021 with a specialization in Applied Arts. Following my insatiable desire
            to delve deeper into the world of visual storytelling, I pursued post-graduation in Applied Arts at RLV
            College of Music and Fine Arts, Tripunithura<br><br> While my academic foundation is rooted in applied arts,
            my heart beats for the intricate realm of illustration. I find immense joy and purpose in breathing life
            into ideas, characters, and worlds through my art.With a keen eye for detail and a love for storytelling, I
            have honed my skills as an illustrator, comic artist,and concept artist.<br><br> My artistic philosophy is
            anchored in the belief that every stroke of the brush or click of the digital pen holds the potential to
            tell a unique story. Whether I am crafting whimsical illustrations, dynamic comic panels, or conceptualizing
            immersive worlds, my focus is to transport viewers into realms where imagination knows no bounds.<br><br>
            Beyond the strokes and pixels, I am committed to sharing my knowledge and passion with others. Teaching is
            not just a profession but a calling, and I take pride in guiding fellow artists on their own creative
            journeys. Join me as we explore the infinite possibilities of illustration and storytelling
            together.<br><br> Thank you for being a part of my artistic odyssey. Let's enter on this creative adventure
            where every line drawn is a step into a
            world of boundless imagination.
